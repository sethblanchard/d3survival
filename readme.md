# d3 Intro and Survival Guide
This repo contains the slides and example presented at [Refresh DC](https://twitter.com/refreshdc) in August 2013. 

The slides for the talk are the keynote and the pdf called d3Survival.

## Examples
The simple example is the complete example demonstrated at the talk. It demonstrates:
- Scales
- Selections
- Axes
- Annotations
- Transitions

Hopefully the comments in the file are enough to illustrate the points I talked through (even if you weren’t there).

The complicated example was one I was going to use to show to to survive using d3. I wasn’t able to get it working enough to demonstrate during the talk. I’m happy to take pull requests on it.
